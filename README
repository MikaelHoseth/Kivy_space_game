README
Hello, i am newbie when it comes to coding games.

This is some casual code i thought i'd share, maybe someone that is stuck will learn, 
or someone that knows much will teach me what i've done wrong.
i am new to github at the moment, so if someone has any ideas to what i could be doing better just tell.

It the start of a funny little casual spacegame written in python 3.7 using Kivy library, version 1.10.1.

The main python file is called "Element_madness.py"


Greetings, MikaelHoseth.
